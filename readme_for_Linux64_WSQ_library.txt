WSQ Image Library (for Linux 64-bit) version 2.0

FBI certified WSQ implementation number: 11282



Electronic fingerprints submitted to the FBI either through Integrated Automated Fingerprint
Identification System (IAFIS), or Electronic Fingerprint Image Print System (EFIPS) may not be
compressed with any technique other than WSQ. 

For fingerprint images WSQ (Wavelet Scalar Quantization) is superior to other lossy
compression methods, such as JPEG, and was chosen by FBI (U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation)
as the fingerprint image compression standard. 

WSQ is a lossy compression method that is well-suited for preserving the very high resolution
details of grayscale images while maintaining high compression ratios of typically 12:1 to 15:1.

Cognaxon WSQ image library provides the easy way to add WSQ image format support to your software
projects using only a few lines of code.

The source code of WSQ library contains 20,099,433 lines of code and saves you months of tedious work.

WSQ image library reads and converts between WSQ and 11 other graphic file formats, it is small (~ 1.5 Megabyte) and fast.
